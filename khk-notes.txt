# Things to write about.

Trying to write as little code as possible to perform game functions on behalf of a player. Instead, everything should be done by the LLM. This means writing more code to summarize game state and coordinate actions between the conversation and task LLMs.

How to avoid sending lots of data to the conversation LLM. my_map() tool as an example.
