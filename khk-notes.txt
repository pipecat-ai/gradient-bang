In-progress
- prompt about map
- move timer for Jon

Sunday
- Clean up finished({message}) in TASK OUTPUT
- this might help us modify code structure so that we do not every pass full map data to conversation LLM
  - remove my_map() from the tools list for the voice bot; add a reference to it in the
    prompt so that the bot can run a task to get a summary of map information as needed
- Further look at all tool calls to better summarize the resulting data structures in text
- See why we broke move UI graphics
- test run_npc.py and status_subscription_demo.py
- commit all files
- remove legacy gg-action keys and legacy result semantics (?)
- utilities to create and manage characters and ports
  - remove character mod args from rpc join
  - create new admin rpc commands grouping that includes port management, too
    - create an admin password that we store in plain text in the world data file


  

# Things to write about.

Trying to write as little code as possible to perform game functions on behalf of a player. Instead, everything should be done by the LLM. This means writing more code to summarize game state and coordinate actions between the conversation and task LLMs.

How to avoid sending lots of data to the conversation LLM. my_map() tool as an example.
