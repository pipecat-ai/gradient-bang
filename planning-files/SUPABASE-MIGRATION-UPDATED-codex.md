# Supabase Migration – Updated Execution Plan (Codex)
**Date:** 2025-11-11

## 1. Purpose & Current Baseline
- Keep the Supabase migration server-only, JSON-in/JSON-out, and 100 % compatible with `utils/api_client.AsyncGameClient` (per `NEXT-supabase-migration-plan.md`).
- Adopt the events/RLS design in `NEXT-supabase-events-implementation.md`: every edge function writes once to `public.events`, records normalized recipients, and lets postgres_changes deliver realtime updates.
- Execute strictly **one edge function at a time** through design, implementation, and payload parity verification before touching the next function. This prevents the partial rewrites that previously stalled Phase 2 and keeps parity visible at every step.

## 2. Baseline Validation – Move Function
- Command used (cloud stack via `.env.cloud`):
  ```bash
  set -a && source .env.cloud && set +a \
    && uv run python scripts/double_run_payload_parity.py \
        tests/integration/test_game_server_api.py::test_move_to_adjacent_sector
  ```
- Result (2025-11-11 16:39:11 UTC logs under `logs/payload-parity/tests_integration_test_game_server_api_py__test_move_to_adjacent_sector/20251111-163911`): `Payloads match; see step5 log for details.`
- Interpretation: `move` edge function, Supabase AsyncGameClient transport, postgres_changes delivery, and parity harness are healthy. This is our template for all future functions.

## 3. Single-Function Implementation Loop
Follow these steps **in order** for every remaining RPC. Do not move to the next function until the prior one is ✅ at every checkpoint.
1. **Select target + confirm dependencies**
   - Confirm required SQL helpers/migrations (`record_event_with_recipients`, sector lookup functions, seeds) exist or capture gaps.
   - Review legacy FastAPI implementation + tests for expected events, timing, error codes.
2. **Design review + checklist stub**
   - Capture inputs/outputs, required scopes (`direct`, `sector`, `corp`, etc.), and recipient reasons inside this doc.
   - Identify shared helpers or data fixtures to touch; add tasks to `planning-files/NEXT-supabase-migration-plan.md` if new migrations/tooling are needed.
3. **Local implementation**
   - Edit `supabase/functions/<function>/index.ts` plus shared helpers only.
   - Run fast feedback: `uv run pytest tests/unit -k <function>` (legacy path) and any targeted helper tests.
4. **Edge + DB verification**
   - `npx supabase db reset` (local) → `npx supabase functions serve --env-file .env.supabase --no-verify-jwt`.
   - `USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1 uv run pytest tests/edge/test_<function>.py -q` (or create the test per §5 in MIG plan).
   - Validate event + recipient rows via SQL queries (e.g., `select event_type, scope, reason from events join event_character_recipients ...`).
5. **Cloud deployment + parity run**
   - `npx supabase functions deploy <function> --project-ref pqmccexihlpnljcjfght --no-verify-jwt`.
   - `source .env.cloud` → `uv run python scripts/double_run_payload_parity.py tests/integration/test_game_server_api.py::test_<function>`.
   - Artifacts: `logs/payload-parity/.../step5_compare.log` stored with the date stamp.
6. **Regression gates & documentation**
   - Supabase + legacy integration tests for the function family (e.g., `-k move`, corp suites) must pass under `USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1` and default mode.
   - Update relevant planning docs with status, edge cases learned, and follow-up work (telemetry, RLS, observer docs).
   - Only after all boxes check ✅ do we unlock the next function.

## 4. Function Backlog & Status
| Order | Domain | Function(s) | Current Status | Immediate Dependencies | Required Tests Before ✅ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Movement / Auth | `join`, `move`, `my_status`, `get_character_jwt` | ✅ Cloud deployed & parity-tested (move) | postgres_changes RLS, AsyncGameClient bridge | `tests/integration/test_game_server_api.py::test_move_to_adjacent_sector`, `tests/edge/test_join.py`, payload parity logs in §2 |
| 1 | Trade & Economy | `trade` (next), then `recharge_warp_power`, `dump_cargo`, `list_known_ports` | 🔄 Pending edge reimplementation (Supabase dir restored from HEAD; rebuild helpers) | `_shared/events.ts` dual-write shim, port fixtures, deterministic credits | `tests/integration/test_game_server_api.py::test_trade_*`, parity run per function, `tests/edge/test_trade.py` |
| 2 | Currency & Power Transfers | `transfer_credits`, `bank_transfer`, `transfer_warp_power`, `purchase_fighters` | ⏳ Blocked until corp defaulting + locking parity confirmed | Economy fixtures + corp account seeding (`supabase_reset_state`) | Economy integration suites (`test_credit_locks.py`, `test_economy_paths.py`), parity harness |
| 3 | Combat | `combat_initiate`, `combat_action`, `combat_tick`, garrison helpers | ⏳ Requires `_shared/combat.ts`, world seeds for corp garrisons, observer fan-out | `record_event_with_recipients`, observer metrics, Supabase reset seeding | `tests/edge/test_combat_auto_engage.py`, `tests/integration/test_combat_system.py`, payload parity per combat scenario |
| 4 | Corporations | `corporation.*` (create/join/leave/kick/info/list, invites, bank ops) | ⏳ Must restore `_shared/corporations.ts`, fix error parity, seed corp fleets | corp tables seeded, RLS policies for corp scopes, AsyncGameClient multi-channel subscribe | `tests/integration/test_corporation_*.py`, `tests/integration/test_event_corporation_filter.py`, parity harness per RPC |
| 5 | Messaging & Admin | `send_message`, admin broadcasts, GM utilities | ⏳ After events schema (recipients + RLS) lands | `record_event_with_recipients`, broadcast recipient table, admin policies | `tests/integration/test_event_system.py`, manual GM broadcast smoke, parity |
| 6 | Remaining utilities | `plot_course`, `path_with_region`, `local_map_region`, salvage endpoints, reset/test helpers | ⚙️ Map endpoints mostly ported but need observer fan-out + docs; salvage pending | `_shared/movement.ts` observer rebuild, salvage helpers | `tests/integration/test_map_visibility.py`, `tests/edge/test_salvage.py`, parity |

### 4.1 Near-Term Function Checklists
- **`trade` (Medium)** – lock port row, debit/credit characters, update commodity stock/prices, emit `trade.executed` + `port.update` to the actor only. Commands: `source .env.cloud && uv run python scripts/double_run_payload_parity.py tests/integration/test_game_server_api.py::test_trade_buy_commodity` plus sell variant. Target: 2–3 h including parity.
- **`recharge_warp_power` (Low)** – require sector 0, deduct credits, refill warp, emit `warp.recharged`. Command: `...::test_recharge_warp_power`. Target: 1–2 h.
- **`transfer_warp_power` & `transfer_credits` (Low)** – ensure both pilots share a sector (warp) / resolve recipient UUID (credits), update balances, emit to both characters. Commands: `...::test_transfer_warp_power`, `...::test_transfer_credits`. Target: ~1–2 h each.
- **Combat (`combat_initiate`, `combat_action`) (High)** – rebuild encounter creation/resolution with `_shared/combat_*.ts`, notify participants + observers, ensure timers/logging align with legacy. Expect 4–8 h per function; run `tests/integration/test_combat_system.py -k initiate` and parity harnesses for each scenario before closing.

Use these checklists as the “definition of done” alongside the status table above; expand with similar bullets for downstream functions as they enter active work.

**Notes:**
- If any prerequisite helper/migration is missing (e.g., `_shared/movement.ts` lost during Week 2 cleanup), treat restoring it as part of the *current* function’s scope before progressing.
- Each function keeps a short “Definition of Done” snippet in this file so future contributors can see exactly which tests/logs prove parity.

## 5. Testing & Verification Matrix
| Layer | Command | When | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FastAPI regression (safety net) | `uv run pytest -q -k <function>` | Before Supabase edits | Ensures we understand legacy behavior.
| Supabase unit/helper | `uv run pytest tests/unit -k <helper>` | During implementation | Validates shared Python helpers unaffected by transport switch.
| Edge runtime | `USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1 uv run pytest tests/edge/test_<function>.py -q` | After local Supabase serve | Requires `npx supabase functions serve` + deterministic world reset.
| Integration (local Supabase) | `USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1 SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321 uv run pytest tests/integration/test_game_server_api.py -k <function> -vv` | Before cloud deploy | Fails fast while still on local stack.
| Payload parity (cloud) | `uv run python scripts/double_run_payload_parity.py tests/integration/...::test_<function>` | After deployment | Produces legacy vs Supabase event logs + compare report; required to close the function.
| Full regression sweep | `USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1 uv run pytest tests/integration -q` (targeted subsets first) | Nightly / before Phase gates | Ensures transport toggle remains transparent.

**Payload parity recap (from `scripts/double_run_payload_parity.py`):**
1. `source .env.cloud` once per shell.
2. Script runs the target pytest node twice—first against FastAPI, then Supabase—writing `events.legacy.jsonl`, `events.supabase.jsonl`, and `step5_compare.log` under `logs/payload-parity/<test>/<timestamp>/`.
3. A function is “done” only when event counts, order, and payloads match exactly (aside from whitelisted timestamps/UUIDs). Use `jq 'select(.record_type=="event")'` on the JSONL files when differences appear.

## 6. Event & Realtime Requirements (apply per function)
- **Single insert:** use or finish `record_event_with_recipients()` so every RPC records the event plus recipients transactionally; no HTTP broadcast calls.
- **Recipient tagging:** compute reasons (`direct`, `sector_snapshot`, `corp_snapshot`, `garrison_owner`, etc.) alongside UUIDs before invoking the SQL helper; this powers metrics and RLS.
- **Async discipline:** edge functions must `await` any delayed work (movement completion, combat ticks) to keep events in order; rely on the 150 s edge timeout (per events plan lessons).
- **Client parity:** `utils/supabase_client.AsyncGameClient` must keep sector + character subscriptions in sync (Phase 2 outstanding task). During each parity run, confirm events appear via postgres_changes and match `tests/helpers/event_capture.py` envelopes.

## 7. Immediate Next Actions
1. **Trade function reimplementation** – rebuild `supabase/functions/trade/index.ts` plus required `_shared/` helpers, then run the full loop in §3 (target parity test: `test_trade_buy_sell_round_trip`).
2. **Finalize `record_event_with_recipients`** – land the SQL helper + TypeScript wrapper so trade (and subsequent functions) can rely on RLS delivery instead of ad-hoc fan-out.
3. **Supabase reset tooling** – ensure `supabase_reset_state()` seeds corp credits/ships so economy + corp parity tests can execute consecutively under Supabase transport.
4. **Document observer rebuild** – capture the new `_shared/movement.ts` contracts (sector occupants, garrisons, observer fan-out) inside this file once re-implemented, because every movement/combat function depends on them.

### Move Function Follow-ups (foundation hardening)
- **Hostile garrison auto-enroll** – wire `_shared/combat.ts` helpers into `supabase/functions/move/index.ts` so moves into hostile sectors trigger enrollment + combat events before extending the combat suite.
- **Realtime sector subscriptions** – teach `utils/supabase_client.AsyncGameClient` to attach/detach `public:sector:{sector_id}` channels on join/move and refresh them when per-character JWTs rotate, matching the requirements captured in `NEXT-supabase-migration-plan.md` §4.
- **Event idempotency constraint** – add the promised `UNIQUE (request_id, event_type, actor_character_id)` constraint to `public.events` so move retries (and other RPCs) can safely re-run without double-logging via `record_event_with_recipients`.
- **Snapshot error handling** – wrap `buildSectorSnapshot` (and similar preflight loads) to emit deterministic `error` events and roll back hyperspace if universe data is missing, preventing silent hangs mid-move.

**Progress (2025-11-11 17:52 UTC):** UNIQUE constraint migration landed, `buildSectorSnapshot` now wrapped with deterministic error handling, and move parity (`test_move_to_adjacent_sector`) re-verified via cloud harness (`logs/payload-parity/tests_integration_test_game_server_api_py__test_move_to_adjacent_sector/20251111-175204`).

**Progress (2025-11-11 18:14 UTC):** Supabase AsyncGameClient now tracks the pilot's sector, deduplicates events across multiple realtime listeners, and automatically attaches/detaches a sector-scoped subscription whenever join/move/status updates change the active sector; parity rerun succeeded (`logs/payload-parity/tests_integration_test_game_server_api_py__test_move_to_adjacent_sector/20251111-181428`).

**Progress (2025-11-11 18:30 UTC):** Added edge test `tests/edge/test_supabase_client_integration.py::test_sector_listener_updates_after_observer_move` to prove observers continue receiving `character.moved` events after relocating, validating the sector subscription machinery before tackling the `trade` RPC.

**Progress (2025-11-11 18:50 UTC):** Deployed the Supabase `trade` edge function and ran payload-parity for both buy and sell paths—`logs/payload-parity/tests_integration_test_game_server_api_py__test_trade_buy_commodity/20251111-185010` and `...test_trade_sell_commodity/20251111-185210`—after aligning Supabase test fixtures (cargo reset helper) and parity comparers so the Supabase transport emits/records deterministic trade + port update payloads.

Maintaining this per-function cadence keeps the migration auditable, limits blast radius when tests fail, and ensures every new Supabase edge function ships with real proof (payload parity logs + integration green) before we touch the next RPC.

**Progress (2025-11-11 22:05 UTC):** Rebuilt the Supabase `recharge_warp_power` RPC to canonicalize incoming character/actor IDs, include ship/sector metadata on both `warp.purchase` and `status.update`, and tighten rate-limit + error fan-out. `tests/unit/test_warp_events.py -k recharge` is green, but the Supabase edge harness currently fails because `_invoke_test_reset` is leaving the local stack without seeded characters (`tests/edge/test_warp_power.py` now dies in `_fetch_ship_id` after the stack bootstrap). We need to stabilize the Supabase reset helper before we can claim supabase-level coverage for warp power.

**Progress (2025-11-11 22:08 UTC):** `dump_cargo` now shares the same ID canonicalization, updates `characters.last_active`, emits `salvage.created`/`status.update` with ship + sector context, and replaces the per-recipient `sector.update` loop with a single `emitSectorEnvelope` so sector observers/garrison owners all fan out from one `events` row. Edge/unit coverage is blocked by the same Supabase reset issue noted above; see `logs/edge-functions.log` around `2025-11-11T21:48Z` for the repeated `character ... not found` stack traces coming out of `_fetch_ship_id`.

**Progress (2025-11-11 22:12 UTC):** `list_known_ports` now normalizes filters, sorts BFS results deterministically, restores the legacy `searched_sectors` field, and emits `ports.list` entries that carry per-port `observed_at` semantics (null while sitting in-sector, otherwise the request timestamp). Unit coverage lives in `tests/unit/test_list_known_ports.py`. The Supabase edge + parity steps are still pending the reset fix, and the parity harness also surfaced an existing blocker: the legacy `AsyncGameClient` no longer exposes `recharge_warp_power`, so `scripts/double_run_payload_parity.py ...test_recharge_warp_power_at_sector_zero` fails with an `AttributeError` (log: `logs/payload-parity/tests_integration_test_game_server_api_py__test_recharge_warp_power_at_sector_zero/20251111-215802/step3_legacy_test.log`). We need to restore that RPC on the Python client before parity will run.

**Progress (2025-11-12 01:08 UTC):** Finished the Supabase reset + payload stabilization pass: edge tests now poll PostgREST to confirm seeded data before proceeding, the legacy `AsyncGameClient` exposes `recharge_warp_power` again, Supabase realtime delivery stops injecting `__event_context`/`request_id` into payloads, and both the edge + parity harnesses for warp recharge are green (`logs/payload-parity/tests_integration_test_game_server_api_py__test_recharge_warp_power_at_sector_zero/20251112-010805`). This unblocks the remaining economy RPCs because we can now trust parity to fail only on real payload drift.

**Progress (2025-11-12 02:13 UTC):** `transfer_warp_power` now mirrors the legacy payloads: IDs are canonicalized server-side but the emitted events carry the same public snapshots as `build_public_player_data`, Supabase reset helpers sync warp/fighter/shield values during test fixture setup, and the cloud parity harness for `test_transfer_warp_power_to_character` matches exactly (`logs/payload-parity/tests_integration_test_game_server_api_py__test_transfer_warp_power_to_character/20251112-021356`). With warp transfers green, we can roll into `transfer_credits` next.

**Progress (2025-11-12 03:26 UTC):** `transfer_credits` now shares the same canonicalization + public snapshot helpers as warp transfers, edge fixtures seed matching credit balances, and both the Supabase edge suite plus `TestCreditTransfers::test_transfer_credits_same_sector` parity harness are green (`logs/payload-parity/tests_integration_test_credit_transfers_py__TestCreditTransfers__test_transfer_credits_same_sector/20251112-032612`). This clears the path to tackle `bank_transfer` and `purchase_fighters` using the same shared snapshot helper.

**Progress (2025-11-12 04:51 UTC):** `bank_transfer` deposits/withdrawals now emit the exact legacy `bank.transaction` payloads (display-name IDs, ship IDs, sector metadata) thanks to the shared public snapshot helper and canonical ID plumbing. Edge tests pass, and both deposit + withdraw parity runs (`logs/payload-parity/tests_integration_test_bank_operations_py__TestBankOperations__test_deposit_credits_in_sector_0/20251112-045040` and `...test_withdraw_credits_in_sector_0/20251112-045113`) report perfect matches. Next stop: `purchase_fighters`.

**Realtime reminder (2025-11-12 06:10 UTC):** Local Supabase (`.env.supabase`) cannot deliver `public:events` via Realtime because the CLI signer is still broken (`:error_generating_signer`). Run parity only after sourcing `.env.cloud`—cloud Realtime works, which is how the 06:00:18 UTC purchase_fighters parity run succeeded. Local edge tests remain valid, but parity must never target the local stack until Supabase fixes the CLI runtime.

**Progress (2025-11-12 16:09 UTC):** `trade` now mirrors legacy semantics end-to-end: incoming IDs are canonicalized, `trade.executed`/`status.update` events include ship + sector metadata, and the actor receives an immediate `port.update` before the rest of the sector via the shared payload helper. Edge tests (`USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1 uv run pytest tests/edge/test_trade.py -q`) pass, the function is redeployed to cloud, and `set -a && source .env.cloud && set +a && uv run python scripts/double_run_payload_parity.py tests/integration/test_game_server_api.py::test_trade_buy_commodity` produces “Payloads match.” Next up in the Trade & Economy tranche is `dump_cargo` (reuse the same canonical ID + shared payload helpers) followed by `list_known_ports` cleanup once dump_cargo parity is green.

**Progress (2025-11-12 17:10 UTC):** `dump_cargo` is deployed to `pqmccexihlpnljcjfght` via `npx supabase functions deploy dump_cargo --project-ref ... --no-verify-jwt`, and the parity harness (`tests/integration/test_cargo_salvage.py::TestCargoSalvage::test_dump_cargo_creates_salvage`) now captures the full join/map/status event sequence thanks to the realtime listener fix in `utils/supabase_realtime.py`. Payload comparison still fails (see `logs/payload-parity/tests_integration_test_cargo_salvage_py__TestCargoSalvage__test_dump_cargo_creates_salvage/20251112-170957/step5_compare.log`) because Supabase emits (a) new salvage IDs/ISO timestamps and (b) an oversized `sector.update.players` list sourced from every ship in sector 5. Salvage metadata needs a comparer that tolerates deterministic UUIDs, and sector snapshots must be trimmed to match legacy's "only currently active players" view before parity can flip green.

**Progress (2025-11-13 06:50 UTC):** `test_reset` edge function completely rewritten to use Supabase REST API instead of PostgreSQL wire protocol (which is blocked in cloud edge functions). Implemented batch insertions (100 records per batch) for characters and ships to avoid timeout with large datasets. Successfully deployed to cloud and verified working with 631 characters (up from 49) - cloud reset completes in under 120s and returns `{"success":true,"inserted_characters":631,"inserted_ships":631}`. This resolves the blocker documented at 2025-11-11 22:05 UTC that was preventing edge tests from seeding characters. The Python test fixture (`tests/helpers/supabase_reset.py`) now seeds all registry characters (not just those with map knowledge files), using fallback map knowledge for characters without files. Edge test infrastructure still needs auth fixes in `tests/edge/support/state.py` before full edge test suite will pass, but test_reset itself is fully operational.

**Ops note (2025-11-11 22:15 UTC):** Local `supabase functions serve` started crashing on `std@0.224.0` because the CLI's edge runtime image still can't load `.d.mts` modules. Temporarily pinned `[edge_runtime].deno_version = 1` in `supabase/config.toml` so the CLI can bootstrap the stack again. Revisit once Supabase ships a Deno 2-compatible edge runtime.

### Execution Order (agreed 2025-11-11 PM)
1. **Idempotency + snapshot safety (low risk, <2 h).** Add the UNIQUE constraint, wrap `buildSectorSnapshot` with deterministic error handling, and rerun the move parity harness to confirm we still match legacy.
2. **Realtime sector subscriptions (medium risk, 2–3 h).** Update `utils/supabase_client.AsyncGameClient` to attach/detach sector channels on join/move and refresh them when per-character JWTs rotate; add/verify an observer notification test so we trust multi-recipient fan-out before porting more RPCs.
3. **Trade edge function (next functional milestone, 3–4 h).** Rebuild `supabase/functions/trade/index.ts` using the checklist in §4.1, then run parity for buy/sell scenarios.
4. **Combat auto-enroll hook (defer to combat phase).** Only reintroduce hostile garrison auto-engage when the combat suite (`combat_initiate`/`combat_action`) is being migrated, so move stays decoupled until the combat helpers exist.

## 8. Deployment & Ops Quick Reference
- **Deploy single function:** `npx supabase functions deploy <name> --project-ref pqmccexihlpnljcjfght --no-verify-jwt` (set env via `npx supabase secrets set KEY=VALUE --project-ref ...`).
- **Watch logs / troubleshoot:** `npx supabase functions logs <name> ...`; DB spot checks via `psql "$SUPABASE_DB_URL" -c "SELECT event_type, inserted_at FROM events ORDER BY inserted_at DESC LIMIT 10;"`.
- **Key metrics:** per-function invocation/error counts, p50/p95/p99 latency, realtime connection health, event delivery latency, DB pool usage (Supabase dashboard → Functions / Database / Realtime tabs).
- **Common issues:**
  - Realtime quiet → confirm `get_character_jwt` deployed, listener subscribed to `public:events`, and `event_character_recipients` rows exist.
  - Missing events → check `record_event_with_recipients` inputs + RLS policies.
  - Rate-limit false positives → inspect `rate_limit_usage` rows; adjust config table if needed.
  - Slow RPC → review function logs for query timing, add indexes before retrying.

## 9. Success Criteria & Lessons to Carry Forward
- **Technical/functional gates:** all 30+ edge functions deployed; integration + payload parity suites green under Supabase; no duplicate or missing events; join/move p95 < 200 ms, combat p95 < 300 ms; NPCs/corps/combat flows validated end-to-end; realtime latency <1 s; map/credit/warp persistence proven; ops runbooks + monitoring/alerts live with rollback tested.
- **Operational checklist before cutover:** 48 h of green tests, load test at ≥100 ops/s for 1 h, backups verified, production secrets set, monitoring + alerting active, rollback procedure rehearsed.
- **Lessons from move:** always await delayed operations (edge timeouts are 150 s), deploy to cloud early (CLI realtime still flaky), trust `postgres_changes` + `record_event_with_recipients` for fan-out, never double-emit via sector + direct, and keep working strictly one RPC at a time with parity proof before moving on.
