# Supabase Migration Plan - Server-Only Architecture

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-09

## 1. Executive Summary
Gradient Bang is moving all persistent state and RPCs from the filesystem + FastAPI stack into a Supabase PostgreSQL project backed by Deno edge functions. The migration stays **server-only** (no public auth), keeps the legacy Python `AsyncGameClient` contract completely intact, and preserves the current integration tests without edits. Work is organized into six execution phases after Week 0 prep, with deterministic universe seeding and an isolated worktree that lets us roll back by redeploying today’s filesystem build.

**Running tests (short version)**
- Install/upgrade Python deps with `uv sync`.
- To let pytest boot the Supabase stack automatically, ensure:
  1. Docker is running locally.
  2. `npx supabase` (or `supabase` CLI) works from the repo root.
  3. `.env.supabase` exists (generated by `supabase start`).
- FastAPI path: `uv run pytest -q` (uses the filesystem backend on port 8002).
- Supabase preview: `USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1 SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321 EDGE_API_TOKEN=<token> uv run pytest tests/integration/test_corporation_*.py -q`. The fixtures will:
  - auto-start `supabase start` if Docker/CLI are available,
  - run `supabase db reset`, and
  - launch `supabase functions serve --env-file .env.supabase --no-verify-jwt`.
  If you prefer to manage the stack manually, export `SUPABASE_MANUAL_STACK=1` **and** start the same services yourself before running pytest.

Core architecture pillars:
- Server-to-server authentication with service-role keys stored in `.env`; edge functions enforce an `X-API-Token`.
- Deterministic world generation ("universe bang") instead of data migration; Supabase can be reset safely at any time.
- Realtime Broadcast channels per character + sector, with every RPC emitting events before returning.
- JSON-in/JSON-out contracts (no Pydantic), mirroring existing `AsyncGameClient` payloads so downstream tooling and tests run unmodified.
- Supabase CLI is invoked through `npx supabase …` to keep Docker + CLI versions aligned across contributors.

## 2. Guardrails & Reference Info
### 2.1 Repository Footing (must stay accurate during the refactor)
- `game-server/`: existing FastAPI code. Leave directory name + import shim in `tests/conftest.py` untouched.
- `supabase/`: Supabase project (`config.toml`, `migrations/`, `functions/`). `_shared/` stores auth, request parsing, rate-limit, event, map, combat, and trading helpers reused by every edge function.
- `utils/`: Clients and helper scripts. `utils/api_client.py` remains the public entry point; `utils/supabase_client.py` provides the Supabase transport behind the same API.
- `npc/`, `pipecat/`, `tools/`, `scripts/`: Operator clients that must continue to import `AsyncGameClient` exactly as they do today.
- `tests/`: Async + integration suites. `tests/edge/` now runs the Supabase stack directly; `tests/integration/` is executed with `USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1` but must not be edited for the migration.

### 2.2 Interface & Testing Invariants
- `AsyncGameClient` constructor signature, keyword-only args, event handlers, and coroutine names must remain byte-for-byte compatible. `utils/api_client.AsyncGameClient` simply dispatches to the Supabase implementation when `SUPABASE_URL`/`USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1` is set.
- Realtime contract: `AsyncGameClient` must keep simultaneous subscriptions to the character topic plus the pilot's current sector (with corp channels once they exist), remap Supabase broadcasts back into the legacy `{event_name, payload, summary}` envelope, and expose the websocket transport + frame callbacks exactly as before (log a warning if a hook becomes a no-op).
- Category 1 tests (`tests/integration/test_game_server_api.py`, combat suites, economy suites, etc.) are never forked. We enforce parity by running them unchanged against the Supabase backend.
- Every newly ported RPC must (1) include the shared auth + rate limiting decorators, (2) emit the same realtime/event payloads as FastAPI, (3) update Supabase fixtures, and (4) pass the relevant unit, edge, and integration tests before it is considered complete.
- Realtime observability stays optional: only set `SUPABASE_REALTIME_DEBUG=1` when debugging. The flag fans out verbose logs to `logs/supabase-client.log` (pytest tails it automatically on timeouts).

### 2.3 Tooling & Commands to keep handy
- Install/update Python deps with `uv sync`. No ad-hoc virtualenvs.
- Reset Supabase locally with `npx supabase db reset`; seed data is pulled from `supabase/migrations/*.sql` and `scripts/universe-bang.py`.
- Serve edge functions during local work: `npx supabase functions serve --env-file .env.supabase.local`.
- Test harnesses:
  - Fast default: `uv run pytest -q` (filesystem backend).
  - Supabase integration: `USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1 SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321 uv run pytest tests/integration/test_game_server_api.py -k move -vv`.
  - Edge smoke tests: `USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1 uv run pytest tests/edge -q` (fixture stands up Supabase via CLI and tears it down per session).
- Deterministic world data still lives under `world-data/`; the Supabase reset helper must regenerate it via `uv run scripts/universe-bang.py 5000 1234` before tests that depend on seeded characters.

### 2.4 Auth, JWT, and RLS Baseline
- Rely on server-issued JWTs instead of Supabase Auth users. Every RLS policy must call a shared `get_authenticated_character_id()` SQL helper that first reads `(auth.jwt() ->> 'sub')::uuid` and only falls back to `auth.uid()` when present, so unauthenticated service traffic never evaluates to NULL.
- `get_character_jwt` now verifies that the caller is authorized to impersonate the requested character (corp ownership, admin override, etc.), issues tokens with a one-hour expiry, and documents the client-side reconnection flow so AsyncGameClient gracefully refreshes subscriptions when the token expires.
- **Realtime token refresh:** `AsyncGameClient` renews Supabase JWTs at T-10 minutes, pauses outbound RPCs while refreshing, re-subscribes to every active topic (character + current sector + corp), and, if downtime exceeds 2 seconds, replays events via `event_query` to guarantee no gaps. Capture the full reconnect state machine in `docs/runbooks/supabase.md` and cover it with an integration test that forces token expiry.
- **Admin/service-role access:** Edge functions recognize three auth tiers: (1) player JWT (RLS-scoped to `character_id`), (2) corp officer JWT (validated via `_shared/actors.require_corp_actor`), and (3) service-role/admin tokens issued via `get_character_jwt(..., is_service_role=True)` and stored only in ops runbooks. Document allowed RPCs per tier, require dual logging (`admin.audit_log`) for tier 3 calls, ensure `tests/edge/test_admin_smoke.py` exercises each path, and note that service-role tokens bypass RLS while admin character JWTs carry an `is_admin` claim for elevated visibility within RLS.
- Snapshot fairness remains the default: characters only see rows captured at insert-time scopes. Admin/service-role overrides are still possible for moderation, but those queries must set `is_service_role()` and are audit logged to keep the fairness principle explicit.
- Security coverage expands during Phase 3: add negative tests for JWT tampering, expired tokens, channel spoofing, and race conditions around corp membership so we prove the new policies correctly deny access.

## 3. Progress Snapshot (2025-11-09)
### 3.1 Completed deliverables
1. **Supabase project + migrations.** `supabase/config.toml` is checked in, and migrations like `20251108093000_initial_schema.sql`, `20251109121500_add_corporations.sql`, and `20251109170000_add_observer_channels.sql` cover the core schema, rate limits, realtime, and corporation metadata. `npx supabase db reset` now seeds deterministic data end-to-end.
2. **Shared helper stack.** `_shared/request.ts`, `auth.ts`, `rate_limiting.ts`, `events.ts`, `map.ts`, `status.ts`, `ships.ts`, and `trading.ts` encapsulate auth, validation, rate limits, payload builders, and event fan-out. Every function imported here uses the same error logging + telemetry fields.
3. **Supabase-native reset + parity harness.** `tests/helpers/supabase_reset.py` now truncates the full schema (universe_config/structure, ports, sector_contents, ships, characters, etc.), reloads the legacy `tests/test-world-data/*.json` fixtures (warps, ports, characters), and is wired into `tests/conftest.py` so `USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1` bootstraps from the same deterministic map + roster as FastAPI. The helper still falls back to `npx supabase db reset` only when needed, and the first Supabase run of `tests/integration/test_combat_system.py::test_two_players_combat_attack_actions` now passes end-to-end.
4. **Edge parity + client coverage.** The missing `event_query` edge function shipped with Supabase-authenticated filters plus `tests/edge/test_event_query.py`, the Supabase client integration suite now uses deterministic `char_id(..)` helpers and pre-test resets (autouse fixture hits `test_reset` before every case), and the warp power/trade RPCs were brought to parity (`recharge_warp_power`, `transfer_warp_power`, AsyncGameClient trade buy) so the entire edge suite is green again.
5. **Ported edge functions.** `supabase/functions/{join,my_status,move,local_map_region,list_known_ports,plot_course,path_with_region,trade,purchase_fighters,ship_purchase,recharge_warp_power,transfer_warp_power,transfer_credits,bank_transfer,dump_cargo}/index.ts` all call into `_shared` helpers, emit the legacy events, and carry unit/edge coverage. Movement parity covers `movement.start`, `movement.complete`, and `map.local`.
6. **Event logging + realtime parity.** `_shared/events.ts` inserts into the `events` table and publishes to `public:character:{id}` / `public:sector:{id}` topics; `tests/edge/test_join.py`, `tests/edge/test_move.py`, and the Supabase AsyncGameClient smoke tests verify broadcasts before RPCs return.
7. **Supabase AsyncGameClient parity.** `utils/supabase_client.py` mirrors the legacy API (including the combat methods `combat_initiate`, `combat_action`, `combat_leave_fighters`, `combat_collect_fighters`, `combat_set_garrison_mode`), exposes the realtime debug toggle, and backs `utils/api_client.AsyncGameClient` without import churn. CI already runs the move subset against this transport.
8. **Economy/ship feature parity shipped.** `supabase/functions/purchase_fighters/index.ts`, `ship_purchase/index.ts`, `bank_transfer/index.ts`, `transfer_credits/index.ts`, and `_shared/trading.ts` re-implement fighter armories, trade-ins, corp-aware debits, and optimistic port locking while emitting the legacy `fighter.purchase`, `ship.traded_in`, and `trade.executed` events.
9. **Corporation schema + RPC plumbing.** `supabase/migrations/20251109121500_add_corporations.sql` adds `corporations`, `corporation_members`, `corporation_ships`, and the corporation-aware columns on `ship_instances` + `characters`. `_shared/corporations.ts` now centralizes invite code generation, membership upserts, ship summaries, and `emitCorporationEvent`, and the full RPC set (`corporation.create/join/leave/kick/regenerate_invite_code/list/info`, `my.corporation`) ships under `supabase/functions/corporation_*/` with coverage in `tests/edge/test_corporations.py`.
10. **Deterministic combat payloads.** Combat encounters seed their RNG from the combat_id, `combat.round_resolved` events compute fighter/shield deltas before mutating in-memory state, and the payload now shows `fighter_loss`/`shield_damage`, matching FastAPI expectations.

### 3.2 Known blockers / open issues
- **Combat fixtures.** `tests/integration/test_combat_system.py::TestBasicCombatScenarios::test_two_players_combat_attack_actions` still 409s because the Supabase reset helper does not seed the deterministic combat pilots/ships that the FastAPI suite expects. Until `supabase_reset_state()` (Phase 4) replays those fixtures, the combat suite cannot pass under Supabase.
- **Observer fan-out + event query.** `_shared/movement.ts` now re-emits realtime `character.moved`/garrison broadcasts, and the missing `supabase/functions/event_query` parity function is implemented (with `tests/edge/test_event_query.py` capturing the JSONL filters). The remaining follow-up is running the legacy FastAPI integration suites after the next server bring-up to double-check AsyncGameClient parity.
- **Docs + CI gap.** The Supabase-specific test workflow lives only in this plan. `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and CI configs still describe the filesystem backend.

### 3.3 Immediate next steps (combat test unblock)
1. **Expand combat coverage.** With `test_two_players_combat_attack_actions` passing under Supabase transport, run `USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1 uv run pytest tests/integration/test_combat_system.py -k "auto_engage or toll or garrison" -vv` (and ultimately the full file) to uncover any remaining encounter/garrison gaps.
2. **Broaden seeded scenarios.** Add the next wave of combat/economy fixtures directly into `tests/helpers/supabase_reset.py` (corp balances, toll garrisons, autopilot ships) so every Supabase run starts from the same deterministic world as FastAPI.
3. **Document & automate the workflow.** Capture the Supabase reset helper, debug flags (`SUPABASE_REALTIME_DEBUG=1`), and stack restart steps in `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, then add a CI leg that runs `npx supabase db reset && USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1 uv run pytest tests/edge -q` plus the combat subset to prevent regressions.
4. **Admin/utility blockers.** Validate `scripts/character_create.py`, `scripts/character_modify.py`, and NPC tooling against the Supabase backend now that `join` no longer auto-creates characters; provide deterministic UUID helpers (already used in edge tests) plus a CI smoke script to ensure future admin endpoints keep parity.

### 3.4 Timeboxed execution plan (Week of 2025-11-10)
To push through the remaining Phase 2 scope, tackle the following day-by-day slices. Each row calls out the concrete artifacts we need plus the signal that the work is truly done.

| Date | Focus | Concrete deliverables | Exit criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mon 2025-11-10 | Observer + movement fan-out | Finalize `_shared/movement.ts` occupant/garrison lookups, update `supabase/functions/{move,join}/index.ts` to emit sector + garrison broadcasts, and add `movement.observers.emitted` counters to structured logs. | `tests/edge/test_move_observers.py` and `tests/integration/test_event_system.py::test_character_moved_visibility` pass under Supabase transport with new logs visible. |
| Tue 2025-11-11 | Combat auto-engage + fixtures | Implement `_shared/combat.ts` enrollment helpers, wire garrison auto-engage payloads, regenerate combat fixtures inside `tests/helpers/supabase_reset.py`, and rerun the combat subset. | `USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1 uv run pytest tests/integration/test_combat_system.py -k "auto_engage or toll or garrison" -vv` is green without FastAPI fallbacks. |
| Wed 2025-11-12 | Deterministic Supabase reset tooling | Finish the standalone `scripts/reset_supabase_state.py` entrypoint, seed corp balances/autopilots, and emit `logs/reset-summary.json` diffs for every reset run. | Full `tests/integration/test_combat_system.py` and `tests/integration/test_economy_paths.py` succeed after `npx supabase db reset` with the new helper. |
| Thu 2025-11-13 | Docs + CI propagation | Update `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/runbooks/supabase.md` with Supabase-only workflow notes, and add a `supabase-edge` CI job that runs `npx supabase db reset && USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1 uv run pytest tests/edge -q -k move`. | CI leg passes twice consecutively and publishes artifacts under `logs/ci-supabase/`; doc PR reviewed. |
| Fri 2025-11-14 | Realtime instrumentation & manual QA | Extend `_shared/events.ts` with `emitMultiSectorEvent`, observer metrics, and structured broadcast logs, then add `scripts/realtime_probe.py` + `tests/edge/test_combat_auto_engage.py` to validate per-sector delivery. | Subscriber probe shows <1 s delivery for sector + character topics and realtime edge tests stay green. |

## 4. Phase Plan Overview
Each phase keeps the overall goals and completion criteria from the original plan but trims completed implementation details. Status legend: ✅ complete, 🟡 in progress, ⏳ upcoming.

### Phase 0 – Prep & Tooling (Week 0) ✅
**Goals**
- Align on Supabase CLI/Docker workflow and environment naming.
- Produce reusable edge templates and capture design decisions.

**What’s locked in**
- `supabase/config.toml`, `.env.supabase`, and local Docker scripts verified via `npx supabase start`.
- Template modules for readonly/mutation handlers live in `_shared/request.ts` and `_shared/auth.ts` and are documented inline.
- Design outcomes (events, combat, schema, testing) captured in `planning-files/supabase-migration-analysis.md` for quick reference.

**Completion criteria**
- Contributors can spin up Supabase locally in <5 minutes.
- Templates + helper stubs exist for all edge categories.

### Phase 1 – Database Setup (Week 1) ✅
**Goals**
- Define schema, constraints, and indexes in Supabase migrations.
- Seed deterministic universe, ship definitions, and corp metadata.

**What’s locked in**
- Migrations listed in §3.1 cover 13 tables, FK constraints, indexes, and realtime channel grants.
- `scripts/universe-bang.py` produces deterministic seeds; `npx supabase db reset` invokes them via migrations.
- Ship economics now live in Supabase (`ship_definitions`, per-ship fighter counts) so trade-ins match `game-server/ships.py`.

**Completion criteria**
- Local Supabase reset produces identical data each run.
- FK + cascade behavior validated inside `tests/edge/test_schema_constraints.py` (see Appendix B for the checklist).

### Phase 2 – Edge Functions + Event Delivery (Week 2) 🟡
**Goals**
- Port every critical RPC together with event payload parity.
- Bring AsyncGameClient + integration suites online against Supabase transport.

**Complete so far**
- Movement, map, trade, fighter, ship, recharge, dump cargo, transfer credits/warp, and bank endpoints listed in §3.1.
- Shared auth/rate limiting/event stack hardened and reused widely.
- Supabase AsyncGameClient + move integration tests run unchanged with `USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1`.

**Outstanding work (detailed)**
1. **Observer + combat fan-out**
   - Finalize `_shared/movement.ts` helpers for sector occupant lookups, garrison notifications, and `movement="depart"/"arrive"` payload builders.
   - Update `move/index.ts` and `join/index.ts` to call the helpers, emit per-sector broadcasts (excluding the actor), and log `movement.observers.emitted` counts.
   - Introduce `_shared/combat.ts` wrappers around `combat_find_active`, `combat_add_participant`, and `combat_start_with_garrisons` SQL functions; auto-enroll movers when hostile garrisons exist.
   - Tests: `tests/edge/test_move_observers.py`, `tests/integration/test_event_system.py::test_character_moved_visibility`, `tests/integration/test_combat_system.py::test_auto_engage_garrison` must pass with Supabase data.
2. **Economy parity polish**
   - Ensure `transfer_credits` and `bank_transfer` default to the client’s tracked character while honoring corp overrides; align error codes with FastAPI responses.
   - Extend fixtures in `tests/fixtures/economy.json` (or Supabase equivalent) so corp + personal accounts exist after `supabase_reset_state()`.
   - Regression coverage: `tests/integration/test_credit_locks.py`, `tests/integration/test_economy_paths.py`, and `tests/unit/test_bank_transfer.py` under Supabase transport.
3. **Docs + CI**
   - Document the Supabase workflow in `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` (edge scaffolding, CLI commands, realtime debugging flag).
   - Add CI job: `npx supabase db reset && USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1 uv run pytest tests/edge -q` plus the move subset (`-k move`). Store logs under `logs/ci-supabase/` for parity audits.
4. **Event ingestion + compat shim**
   - Build the `record_event_with_recipients()` SQL function, wrap it from `_shared/events.ts`, and gate the rollout with `emitCharacterEventCompat` so we can dual-write to the legacy broadcast path while recipients tables are backfilled.
   - Add a `UNIQUE (request_id, event_type, actor_character_id)` constraint and make the SQL function return the existing `event_id` to keep retries idempotent (the SupabaseRealtimeListener will use this ID for cross-topic deduplication).
   - Update `_shared/events.ts` logging to call the new SQL function and capture the structured metrics described in §5.3, including per-recipient snapshots stored transactionally.
5. **Observer + recipient documentation**
   - Decide which fan-out inputs (sector observers, garrisons, corp members) are computed in TypeScript vs SQL, document the contract, and include before/after snippets (see §5.3) for helpers like `emitCharacterMovedEvents`.
   - Publish the observer_channels deprecation path and migration steps for `emitSectorEnvelope()` so no code depends on the JSONB column once RLS-driven delivery replaces it.
6. **Sector subscription parity**
   - Teach `utils/supabase_client.AsyncGameClient` to subscribe to `public:sector:{sector_id}` alongside the character topic, lazily attach/detach sector channels on `move`/`join`, and guard against race conditions while JWTs refresh.
   - Extend `tests/integration/test_event_system.py::test_character_moved_visibility` (and similar corp/combat suites) to run under Supabase transport and assert that non-actor clients observe peer movement and combat events without code changes.
7. **Broadcast durability + dedupe**
   - Replace `Promise.all` fan-out loops with `Promise.allSettled()` (or equivalent) so one failed recipient does not abort the rest; log failures with `broadcast.failure` metrics and enqueue retries or dead-letter entries for investigation.
   - Update `utils/supabase_realtime.py` to deduplicate events across all subscribed topics using the `event_id` recorded via `record_event_with_recipients()`, and document the ordering guarantees for multi-topic deliveries.

**Completion criteria**
- All movement + economy + observer tests pass through Supabase transport with zero test file edits.
- AsyncGameClient toggles between transports automatically (env-based) and remains transparent to callers.
- Documentation + CI describe and enforce the Supabase workflow.

### Phase 3 – Event System Hardening & Realtime QA (Week 3) ⏳
**Goals**
- Validate multi-channel realtime delivery, rate limits, and telemetry.
- Exercise combat observers, per-sector broadcasts, and error reporting under load.
- Finalize cross-topic deduplication + ordering guarantees and prove JWT refresh/reconnect flows keep subscriptions healthy without dropping events.

**Key tasks**
- Expand `_shared/events.ts` with `emitMultiSectorEvent` + observer metrics, then add structured logs for broadcast counts and delivery failures.
- Build Supabase-native smoke tests for combat + observer pipelines (`tests/edge/test_combat_auto_engage.py`, realtime subscriber harness in `tests/edge/helpers/realtime.py`).
- Instrument `npc/simple_tui` and the voice bot to consume Supabase realtime events end-to-end via `utils/supabase_client.py`.
- Implement SupabaseRealtimeListener reconnection logic (token refresh, sector re-subscribe, dedupe cache) and document the guarantees/limitations in §5.3 + `docs/runbooks/supabase.md`.
- Prototype RLS policies directly on `public.events`/recipient tables, run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` against `visible_events` queries with 10K/100K rows, and add any covering indexes needed to keep p95 <200 ms.
- Add rate limit dashboards (leveraging Supabase metrics + logs) and alert thresholds.
- Expand the Supabase security test suite with JWT tampering, expired tokens, wrong-channel subscriptions, and corp membership churn races to validate the new policies.
- Harden realtime fan-out so it survives local and CI load (retry/backoff, sequential broadcasts, better error surfacing), then remove the temporary `EDGE_DISABLE_REALTIME` default and re-enable `tests/edge/test_supabase_client_integration.py` by default.

**Completion criteria**
- Realtime topics (`public:character:{id}`, `public:sector:{id}`) verified via automated tests and manual subscribers.
- Rate limiting proves effective via synthetic load (no false positives in move/join smoke tests).
- Combat observers auto-enroll pilots without FastAPI fallbacks.
- Full edge suite (including Supabase client integration tests) passes with realtime broadcasting enabled by default on both auto-managed and manual stacks.
- `utils/supabase_realtime.py` demonstrates lossless reconnection (JWT refresh, sector re-subscribe) and cross-topic deduplication keyed by `event_id` during the realtime probe tests.

### Phase 4 – Data Tooling & Validation (Week 4) ⏳
**Goals**
- Turn deterministic seeding + reset paths into reusable tooling.
- Replace the FastAPI `test.reset` fixture with a Supabase-native helper. ✅ `supabase/functions/test_reset` now truncates/reseeds via SQL + fixture JSON, so AsyncGameClient can call the same RPC in Supabase mode.

**Key tasks**
- Implement `scripts/reset_supabase_state.py` (or similar) that truncates runtime tables, reruns migrations/seeds, and provisions deterministic test characters (combat pilots, corp accounts, observer bots).
- Update pytest fixtures to call the new reset helper directly (no HTTP hop). Share logic between `tests/edge`, `tests/integration`, and integration smoke scripts under `tests/helpers/`.
- Validate world data parity by diffing Supabase tables vs `world-data/` (target: 5,000 sectors, ~200 ports, corp seeds) and logging counts under `logs/world-validate.json`.

**Completion criteria**
- `supabase_reset_state()` fixture exists and is used by all Supabase-aware tests.
- Deterministic combat/economy characters appear automatically after each reset, unblocking the combat suites.
- Validation script reports zero drift between seeds and live tables.

### Recovery Status – 2025-11-10
- A local cleanup inadvertently deleted the entire `supabase/` directory after the Week 2 edge-function work (test_reset, event_query, movement observers, shared helpers, fixtures). The directory was restored from `HEAD`, which means all in-progress Supabase code (including `_shared/movement.ts`, `_shared/events.ts`, and observer helpers) is currently missing and must be recreated before Phase 2 resumes.
- The pytest fixture briefly cloned `supabase/` into `.supabase-test-workdir/`, causing the Supabase CLI watcher to rewrite duplicate files and constantly restart the edge runtime; this directory has been removed, and the fixture now always invokes `supabase … --workdir supabase`.
- **Immediate recovery plan:**
  1. Re-create the Supabase project files exactly as described in `docs/supabase-migration-review-UPDATED.md` (test_reset, event_query, movement observers, `_shared` modules, fixtures).
  2. Re-run `npx supabase db reset --workdir supabase` followed by `UV run pytest tests/edge/test_admin_smoke.py -q` to verify the rebuilt functions.
  3. Recommit the Supabase directory to prevent accidental loss and add `scripts/recover_supabase.sh` (optional) documenting how to regenerate the folder from fixtures.
  4. Keep `.supabase-test-workdir/` out of the repo; rely solely on `--workdir supabase` when calling the CLI.

Until these recovery tasks are finished, treat the Supabase port as “degraded” and pause work on Phase 4+ items.

### Phase 5 – Testing & Optimization (Week 5) ⏳
**Goals**
- Run the full integration suite against Supabase transport and capture latency metrics.
- Finalize the Supabase Python SDK integration for all bots/tools.

**Key tasks**
- Execute every file in `tests/integration/` with `USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1`; log p50/p95/p99 latencies for `join`, `move`, `trade`, `my_status`, and critical corp/economy flows.
- Compare Supabase vs FastAPI metrics and document SLOs (p95 <200 ms, p99 <500 ms) in `docs/operations/perf-matrix.md`.
- Define and run concrete load scenarios before sign-off:
  - Scenario A: single corp, 30 members, sustain 50 moves/sec for 10 minutes without >1% errors.
  - Scenario B: 10 corps (100 total pilots) mixing move/trade/combat/chat at 10 ops/sec for 5 minutes, p99 <500 ms.
  - Scenario C: burst of 200 moves within 10 seconds (midnight rush) with <2 s queueing delay.
- Update `npc/run_npc.py`, `npc/simple_tui.py`, `tools/firehose_viewer.py`, and CLI scripts to import the Supabase client (no API changes required).
- Ensure `utils/supabase_realtime.py` (listener) mirrors the legacy event subscription API and is covered by unit tests.

**Completion criteria**
- All integration + edge suites pass against Supabase with logs stored for audit.
- Voice bot + NPC tooling operate solely on Supabase.
- Performance report attached to this plan + CLAUDE.md.

### Phase 6 – Cutover & Deployment (Week 6) ⏳
**Goals**
- Validate, tag, and deploy the Supabase stack; monitor production.

**Key tasks**
- Pre-cutover checklist: confirm all 30+ edge functions deployed, secrets set via `npx supabase secrets set`, rate limits tuned, backups tested.
- Deployment runbook: tag `pre-supabase`, flip environment variables, restart voice bot/NPC services, and run smoke tests (join, move, trade, combat) immediately after.
- Post-cutover monitoring: track edge invocations, response times, error rates, realtime delivery latency, and billing alerts (50/75/90%).
- Documentation + runbooks in `docs/runbooks/supabase.md` cover troubleshooting, reset procedures, and rollback steps (deploy legacy worktree).

**Completion criteria**
- Production is Supabase-backed with <1% error rate and validated monitoring.
- Rollback remains a simple deploy of the legacy branch.
- Team-wide training + documentation completed.

## 5. Detailed Backlogs (Future Work Organization)
### 5.1 Database & Seeding Tasks
- **FK/constraint validation:** Track the Appendix B checklist (`sector_contents.port_id`, `characters.current_ship_id`, etc.) via a dedicated `tests/edge/test_schema_constraints.py` (add this file if it does not exist yet) so every cascade/constraint stays exercised.
- **Events schema cleanup (Week 1 blocking):** Remove the legacy `character_id` recipient column from `events`, rename `sender_id` to `actor_character_id`, allow NULL actors for admin/system events, and drop the unused `direction` enum. Recipients now live exclusively in `event_character_recipients`, so update migrations, `_shared/events.ts`, and docs together with a `UNIQUE (request_id, event_type, actor_character_id)` constraint for retry safety.
- **Actor vs ship documentation:** Add a short §4.5 note clarifying how `actor_character_id` (pilot/corp officer) and `ship_id` (controlled hull) relate, especially for corp-owned ships and autopilot events, so recipients, audits, and clients interpret context the same way.
- **Base-table RLS:** Policies attach directly to `public.events`, `event_character_recipients`, and related tables; `visible_events` becomes a SECURITY BARRIER view that simply selects from the protected tables. Document this so nobody attempts unsupported RLS-on-view definitions during implementation.
- **Helper SQL functions (required):** land `get_characters_aware_of_sector(sector_id)` in a migration and ensure it can run inside the same transaction as `record_event_with_recipients()` (use `FOR SHARE` where needed) so observer and garrison recipient lists are snapshot-consistent.
- **Supabase reset helper:** Script under `scripts/reset_supabase_state.py` that truncates runtime tables, reruns migrations, copies deterministic combat/economy fixtures, and writes a JSON summary to `logs/reset-summary.json`.
- **Universe + corp seeds:** Ensure `supabase/migrations/*seed*.sql` (or `scripts/universe-bang.py --sql`) generates ships, ports, and corporation rows identical to the filesystem data. Include starter corp credits + autopilot characters for combat/economy tests.

### 5.2 Edge Function Coverage Map
| Domain | Functions (status) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Character lifecycle | `join`, `my_status` ✅; `character_create`, `character_delete`, `character_modify` ⏳ | Use shared auth + status builders; create/delete must emit `character.created`/`character.deleted` events and update corp tables.
| Movement/navigation | `move`, `plot_course`, `path_with_region`, `local_map_region` ✅ | Observer/garrison fan-out still pending (§4 Phase 2).
| Trade/economy | `trade`, `list_known_ports`, `dump_cargo`, `transfer_credits`, `bank_transfer`, `recharge_warp_power`, `transfer_warp_power`, `purchase_fighters` ✅ | Finish corp defaulting + locking behavior before closing Phase 2.
| Ship acquisition | `ship_purchase` ✅ | Ensure corp autopilot + trade-in telemetry stays in sync with `game-server/shipyard.py`.
| Combat | `combat_initiate`, `combat_action`, `combat_tick` (scaffolds exist) | Need Supabase fixtures plus `_shared/combat_*.ts` helpers to handle enrollment, timers, and victory resolution.
| Corporations | `corporation.create`, `corporation.join`, `corporation.leave`, `corporation.kick`, `corporation.regenerate_invite_code`, `corporation.list`, `corporation.info`, `my.corporation` ✅ | Shared helper `_shared/corporations.ts` drives membership + events; smoke coverage lives in `tests/edge/test_corporations.py`. Next up: admin corps (`corporation.modify/delete`) if/when they matter.

**Supabase integration gaps (Nov 2025)**
1. **Error parity:** `corporation.kick` currently returns 500 for several validation errors (kicking yourself, kicking someone outside the corp, non-existent characters). FastAPI returns 400/404. Fix the edge function to match legacy codes/messages so `tests/integration/test_corporation_errors.py` passes under Supabase.
2. **Credit overrides for tests:** FastAPI corp tests set ship credits via `managed_client(..., credits=...)` (updates knowledge/ships JSON). Supabase bypasses those files and reads DB state, so corp creation never fails with “Insufficient credits”. Add a Supabase-specific reset hook (e.g., use `tests/edge/support/state.reset_character_state`) so the integration fixtures can set credits/sector/warp before each test when `USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1`.
3. **Event payload mismatches:** `corporation.member_joined`, `corporation.member_left`, etc., are missing legacy fields (`member_id`, etc.) or emit different shapes. Align Supabase payloads with `game-server/api/corporation_*.py` and verify via `tests/integration/test_corporation_events.py`.

### 5.3 Event Pipeline Upgrades
- **Atomic ingestion:** Ship a `record_event_with_recipients()` SQL function (Phase 2) that inserts the event + recipients + broadcast reasons in one transaction, enforces `UNIQUE (request_id, event_type, actor_character_id)`, and returns existing IDs on retries. `_shared/events.ts` becomes a thin wrapper over this function, and the legacy per-recipient HTTP broadcasts continue via a dual-write compat shim until cutover.
- **Code migration examples:** Add §6.4 “code migration playbook” showing how helpers like `emitCharacterMovedEvents` compute recipient arrays (sector observers, garrisons, corps) before calling the SQL function, and how reason tags are attached. This supplements the high-level guidance so every edge function refactor follows the same pattern.
- **Recipient computation contracts:** Keep complex fan-out (garrisons, observer lists, corp snapshots) in TypeScript edge helpers where we already have cached corp/ship context, but document exactly which arrays must be passed into the SQL function. Confirm whether any of this logic needs to move into SQL for auditing, and flag the decision before Phase 2 closes.
- **Observer/channel cleanup:** Explicitly deprecate `observer_channels` + `emitSectorEnvelope()` once RLS-driven events land. Until then, document how they coexist and describe the migration/removal steps (including data cleanup), plus add a dated timeline + migration script so everyone knows when the JSONB column disappears.
- **Partial failure handling:** Standardize on `Promise.allSettled()` (or equivalent) in `_shared/events.ts` fan-out helpers, emit `broadcast.failure` events for any rejected recipients, and describe the dead-letter / retry policy.
- **Cross-topic dedup + ordering contract:** Document that broadcast payloads carry `event_id` + `emitted_at`, explain ordering expectations across character/sector/corp topics, and spell out how SupabaseRealtimeListener dedupes globally using those IDs.
- **Client payload bridge:** Update `utils/supabase_realtime.py` and AsyncGameClient to unwrap `postgres_changes` INSERT payloads back into `{event, payload}` envelopes, and spell out how `event_query` now targets `visible_events` (with RLS) so the legacy RPC contract continues to return identical JSON.
- **Legacy payload bridge implementation:** Supabase realtime delivers `{type, topic, event, payload}` frames, but legacy clients expect `{event_name, payload, summary}` envelopes. `utils/supabase_realtime.py` must (a) map `event` -> `event_name`, (b) inject `summary` via the existing formatter registry, (c) attach `__event_id` + `__emitted_at` metadata for dedupe, and (d) expose a validation helper so tests can diff Supabase vs FastAPI envelopes byte-for-byte. Capture the translation rules in Appendix D with JSON examples for movement, combat, corp, and trade events.
- **Payload schema appendix:** Add a JSON-schema appendix for each event type (movement, combat, corp, trade, map) and gate merges on schema validation tests so summary formatters cannot silently break.
- **Corporation/garrison scaling:** Capture guardrails for corp/garrison fan-out (recipient caps, potential `public:corporation:{id}` topics, pagination) and include perf testing expectations.
- **Recipient enforcement via RLS:** Document how `record_event_with_recipients()` writes authoritative recipient rows checked by base-table RLS so logic bugs cannot leak events, and add verification queries/tests to prove policies align with helper computations.
- **Event naming + docs:** Adopt the `{scope}.{category}.{action}` convention (e.g., `sector.character.moved`, `corp.chat.message`, `broadcast.gm.announcement`) and capture it in §7 so filtering logic and future tooling remain predictable.
- **Telemetry:** Have `record_event_with_recipients()` emit structured metrics (`event.recorded` notices with scope, recipient counts, duration_ms) so we can trace ingestion problems and validate realtime delivery during Phase 3.

**Progress – Nov 10, 2025**
- Centralized corporation-actor authorization lives in `_shared/actors.ts` and is now enforced by the movement, trade, status, map, bank, combat, and transfer edge functions. These handlers also canonicalize actor IDs before enforcing rate limits.
- Supabase AsyncGameClient regained the missing public RPC helpers (`purchase_fighters`, `recharge_warp_power`, `transfer_*`, bank helpers, combat helpers), keeping the drop-in contract identical to the legacy transport.
- Combat enrollment now includes corporation-owned ships via `_shared/combat_participants.loadCharacterCombatants`, unblocking the Supabase corp combat suite once DB seeding populates `corporation_ships`.

**Next Steps (short term)**
1. Apply the new authorization helper to any remaining endpoints (`join`, corp admin RPCs) and ensure unauthorized actors are rejected before they can move, chat, or trade. Re-run `tests/integration/test_corporation_ships.py` to confirm the “rejects unauthorized actor” expectations.
2. Match legacy error messaging for invalid corp ship joins (e.g., return “ship not registered” for 404) so `test_corporation_ship_invalid_id_rejected` aligns with FastAPI.
3. Seed `corporation_ships`/`ship_instances.owner_type='corporation'` during test resets so Supabase corp fleets exist in the DB; once done, rerun the full Supabase corp integration batch (`tests/integration/test_corporation_*.py tests/integration/test_event_corporation_filter.py`).

**Next steps:** patch the three gaps above, rerun `USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1` corp integration suites, and then tackle remaining functional gaps (combat, salvage, admin endpoints).
| Salvage & events | `salvage_collect`, `send_message` pending (`event_query` ✅) | `salvage_collect` uses `_shared/salvage.ts`; `event_query` now exposes pagination/filtering for clients to catch up; `send_message` allows admin broadcasts (per-character insert + broadcast).

### 5.4 SDK, Tooling, and Client Work
- `utils/supabase_realtime.py`: mirror the legacy `RealtimeEventListener` interface (`on`, `on_any`, `start`, `stop`), subscribe to `character:{id}` **and** current-sector/corp topics, and expose connection status callbacks plus event-id dedupe safeguards.
- Supabase AsyncGameClient transport: standardize on `transport="supabase"` (auto-converting legacy `"websocket"`), emit warnings when deprecated frame callbacks are supplied but still call the hook so existing tooling keeps logging frames.
- Character identity bridge: document and test how display names are canonicalized to UUIDs, ensure every outbound payload includes the legacy display label, and add schema tests so summary formatters keep working.
- Summary + payload validation: add snapshot/JSON-schema tests for all event payloads, and make `summary_formatters` run against Supabase events during CI.
- CLI & ops tools: Update `npc/run_npc.py`, `npc/simple_tui.py`, `pipecat_server/bot.py`, and `tools/*.py` scripts to rely on `utils/api_client.AsyncGameClient` without extra flags; only configuration change should be Supabase env vars.
- Documentation: `docs/runbooks/supabase.md` (local dev, debugging, reset), `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` updates explaining the Supabase-only auth model, AsyncGameClient bridge, JWT refresh guidance, and troubleshooting for rate limits, dedupe, or realtime noise.

### 5.5 Testing & QA Backlog
- **Per-test reset:** Replace HTTP-based reset with Python fixtures that call `supabase_reset_state()`; share helper in `tests/helpers/server_fixture.py`. (New edge `test.reset` endpoint is also available for AsyncGameClient parity, and `tests/helpers/supabase_reset.py` now proxies to it before falling back to direct SQL. Supabase mode already triggers the RPC before each test via `tests/conftest.reset_test_state`; FastAPI path still needs to adopt the shared helper.)
- **Edge test expansion:** Ensure every edge function has at least one test under `tests/edge/` that (a) hits the function via Supabase CLI serve, (b) asserts DB side effects, and (c) verifies realtime payloads when applicable.
- **Integration coverage:** Nightly CI should run the entire `tests/integration/` matrix under both transports until Supabase fully replaces FastAPI. Log outputs under `logs/ci-supabase/` for debugging.
- **Manual smoke scripts:** Lightweight scripts in `scripts/` (e.g., `scripts/manual_credit_smoke.py`, `scripts/manual_combat_smoke.py`) that call Supabase endpoints directly to reproduce production issues.
- **Payload parity harness:** For each integration test we care about, run a two-pass workflow that captures AsyncGameClient envelopes from the legacy server and compares them to Supabase output:
  1. Legacy capture run—unset Supabase env vars, set `ASYNC_CLIENT_PAYLOAD_DUMP=/tmp/<test>.legacy.jsonl`, and run the pytest node. `utils/api_client.AsyncGameClient`’s dump hook records every `{event_name, payload, summary}` envelope plus request_id/timestamps to that file.
  2. Supabase comparison run—set `USE_SUPABASE_TESTS=1`, point at the local Supabase stack, set `ASYNC_CLIENT_PAYLOAD_DUMP=/tmp/<test>.supabase.jsonl`, and rerun the same pytest node. The Supabase transport writes its envelopes in the same format.
  3. Comparison—call `scripts/compare_payloads.py /tmp/<test>.legacy.jsonl /tmp/<test>.supabase.jsonl`. The script sorts by event_id, ignores transport-only metadata, and fails loudly if any envelope differs. Store passing comparison logs under `logs/payload-parity/<test>/` so the process remains self-documenting.

### 5.6 Deployment & Monitoring Checklist
- Supabase secrets managed through `npx supabase secrets set` (no plain-text `.env` for production). Document required vars in Appendix B.
- Monitoring: enable Supabase dashboard alerts for invocation count, error rate, response latency, and billing thresholds; pipe key metrics into Grafana once Phase 5 perf work lands.
- Logging: centralize edge function logs (structured JSON) in `logs/edge/*.log` locally and configure production log drains (Supabase → Logflare or similar) before cutover.
- Rollback: keep Supabase work in a dedicated worktree/branch so reverting is a deployment, not a data migration.

## 6. Risks & Mitigations
1. **Seed data integrity.** Mitigate with deterministic generators, `supabase_reset_state()`, and validation scripts that diff expected vs actual counts after each reset.
2. **Performance regressions.** Benchmark every critical RPC during Phase 5, add indexes where needed, and watch Supabase metrics for slow queries.
3. **Event delivery gaps.** Dual-write to the `events` table + realtime channels, and provide `event_query` so clients can replay missed payloads. Add structured `broadcast.*` logs when fan-out fails.
4. **Rate-limiting false positives.** Start with conservative limits stored in `_shared/rate_limiting.ts`, emit metrics on each throttle, and tune thresholds once telemetry accumulates.

## 7. Success Criteria
### Technical
- 100% of edge functions deployed and passing tests.
- `join`/`move` p95 <200 ms, p99 <500 ms (logged during Phase 5 test runs).
- Event delivery latency <1 s and zero drops verified via subscriber tests.
- Seeds + Supabase state stay in sync (validation job passes).
- Legacy AsyncGameClient (unchanged code) passes the full integration suite against Supabase transport, including cross-character observer tests.
- Realtime bridge emits payloads that match the legacy `{event_name, payload, summary}` schema byte-for-byte (verified via schema + snapshot tests).

### Functional
- Voice bot, NPC tooling, CLI scripts, and AsyncGameClient consumers operate solely via Supabase.
- Trading, combat, corp, and observer workflows behave identically to the filesystem backend (proved via unchanged integration tests).
- Map knowledge and universe data persist correctly across resets.

### Operational
- Team trained on Supabase operations; docs + runbooks updated.
- Monitoring + billing alerts configured at 50/75/90% of plan limits.
- Backup/restore and rollback procedures tested prior to cutover.

## 8. Post-Migration Enhancements (optional backlog)
After the server-only cutover stabilizes, we can consider multi-ship support, event partitioning, richer leaderboards, analytics dashboards, and a possible read-only public API with RLS. These are deliberately out-of-scope for the six-week migration but remain captured here for future planning.

## 14. Next Actions
1-5: unchanged from prior revision.
6. Draft Appendix D with JSON transformation examples for movement, combat, corp, and trade events (used by the legacy payload bridge validation helper).
